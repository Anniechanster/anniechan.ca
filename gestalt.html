    <p itemprop="text">Gestalt is an organized whole that is perceived as more than the sum of its parts. The purpose of this project is to create an art piece using shapes and lines that create a whole image. These shapes and lines are strategically used together to lead the viewers eye across the entire composition.

    <h3 itemprop="headline" class="push-1-2">Style</h3>
    <p itemprop="text">This piece was inspired by an artist named, Charley Harper. He was well-known for his highly stylized wildlife illustrations. Harper captured the essence of his subjects with the fewest visual elements possible. Similarly, in this pieace, a Puffin is illustrated catching their prey in their natural habitat. Using only blocks of shape and continuous lines, a gestault piece was created.
