    <h3 itemprop="headline">The Redesigned Logo</h3>
    <p itemprop="text">The logo represents the best qualities
    and characteristics of Morrison’s Unisex
    Hair Design & Esthetics identity. The
    logo has been created with dynamic
    flexibility that reflects their stylists’ ability to professionally style and treat hair.</p>
    <p itemprop="text">In a single glance, the logo shows the
    versatility of Morrison’s Unisex Hair
    Design and Esthetics. The concept of
    the logo uses the letter <i>M</i> in Morrison’s and incorporates two elegant, wave-like shapes in the letter, replacing the right diagonal stroke. These two shapes symbolize hair or a hairpiece that represents Morrison’s main service, which is hairstyling. The hairpiece symbol is easily understood and recognized. The bilateral serifs found at the foot of the <i>M</i> creates a sense of stability and reliance of the logo.</p>
    <p itemprop="description">Overall, the logo elegantly
    works together, creating a luxurious feel
    to the brand.</p>
